### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Login creates a question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ppa/frontend/cypress/integration/student/manageQuestions.js)
 - [Login creates a question and checks user](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ppa/frontend/cypress/integration/student/manageQuestions.js)
 - [Student submits question, teacher login, approves and gives justification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ppa/frontend/cypress/integration/justification/justification.js)

#### Rationale
In our point of view end-to-end tests are very important because they replicate the user´s behavior on the application that we are testing so we can assure that every thing is working correctly from the data base and back-end all the way to the front-end.

### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [login creates and deletes a clarification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ddp/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createClarifications.js#L14)
 - [login creates two course executions and deletes it](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ddp/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createClarifications.js#L20)
 - [login creates a clarification with an empty request](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ddp/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createClarifications.js#L34)
 - [login update clarification](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ddp/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createClarifications.js#L17)
 - [login update clarification and tries to send empty response](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/ddp/frontend/cypress/integration/student/createClarifications.js#L24)

#### Rationale
By implementing the tests we come to the conclusion that the end-to-end tests ensure that all integrated pieces works as they are supposed to do. 
Also we could say that is a more effective way to see how the website works in the simulated "real life conditions".

### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Login creates a tournament](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_46-project/blob/tdp/frontend/cypress/integration/tournament/manageTournament.js#L12)

#### Rationale
In our point of view end-to-end tests are very important because they replicate the user´s behavior on the application that we are testing so we can assure that every thing is working correctly from the data base and back-end all the way to the front-end.
This allow us, programmers, trough tools like cypress automate end-to-end tests and having this well-written can save us hours of development time and can prevent bugs and unexpected behaviors before entering the production phase.
